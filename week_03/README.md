# Final Data for Visualization

## Data Source 
**Title:** RMS Crime Incidents
**Source:** Detroit Police Department
**Location:** City of Detroit
**Link:** https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::rms-crime-incidents/explore?location=42.352949%2C-83.099050%2C10.73

## About 
All incidents for which evidence of a crime was found by the Detroit Police Department, necessitating reporting to the Michigan Records Management Services. 

## Reason for Interest
How crime within a city is reported and presented influences how policy in all realms of governance is created. In Detroit, this is no different. Much focus is put on the overall rates of violence and property crimes. However, I and many others in Detroit feel that many details are missed in how crime in the city is discussed. This missing nuance leads to too much attention and resources being put on 'band-aid' solutions to quality of life issues in the city. By taking alternative approaches to visualizing the instances of 'crime' in the city, those missing details may make themselves more obvious. 

## Thoughts on Use
The intention of using this data is to tie the location's other attributes to the physical locations of crimes. By combining this data with other known information on the immediate vicinity of these instances, I would build a narrative on the environmental conditions that are conducive to various crimes of concern. 

## Potential Data Points
- offense_description
- offense_category
- incident_timestamp
- year
- precinct
- longitude 
- latitude

## Concerns with data
Most obvious is the missing instances of reported but unsubstantiated reports of crimes committed. This data could still be useful for analysis and answer the question of how crime differs across the city. 
Another concern is that this dataset is limited to data on the crimes reported and its location, for further analysis on the environmental variables, other dataset(s) could be joined to this one to increase the dimensionality.
