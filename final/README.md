# Final Visualization Project

## About the Project

This project uses data visualization as a tool in validating the efficacy of government interventions. 
To that end, a public [dataset](https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::rms-crime-incidents/explore?location=42.352899%2C-83.099050%2C10.73) from the Detroit Open Data Portal was transformed and joined to geographic data from the same source to create visualizations
