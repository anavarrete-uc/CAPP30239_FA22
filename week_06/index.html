    <div class = "container", id = 'p'>
        <h1>Was the victim mentally ill?</h1>
        <div id = "pie"></div>
        For this set of charts, I decided to look at the correlation between 
        the mental health state of the gunshot victim and other data points. 
        In this simple pie chart, you see the overrepresentation of mentally ill 
        victims. I chose this representation since this would be analyzing to portions 
        that make up the whole of the dataset, out of that subset that had values for this 
        data point. I first thought of using a bar chart to show the relatively close heights, to 
        show this overrepresentation. However, since this would be at examining two parts of a whole and the 
        difference between the two values is significant, I believe that the overrepresentation is most apparent in a pie chart. 
        For this chart, additional data that would be useful would be the exact proportion of mentally ill individuals
        relative to the general population, possibly broken down by ailment. Thus, this chart currently relies on what 
        would be a reasonable assumption that the reader does not contest that this is a high proportion. 
    </div> 
    <div class =  "container">
        <h1>Age distribution of mentally ill victims</h1>
        <div id = "hist"></div>
        This histogram tells the story of how younger people with mental illnesses are more likely to 
        be victims of police violence than their older counterparts. I decided to go with a histogram to best show 
        a distribution along one axis of interest. One way to interpret the takeaway may rely on 
        the assumption that mentally ill people of all ages are in confrontations with police at the same rates. 
        Regardless, another takeaway is the vast bulk of the victims in total being relatively young, 
        when keeping in mind the overrepresentation of mentally ill victims from the previous graphic,
        being young mentally ill individuals. Additional data that would be useful would be the rate of
        police confrontations amongst mentally ill people of all ages. 
    </div>
    <div class = "container", id = 'h'>
        <h1>Counts in Midwest</h1>
        <div id = "barchart"></div>
    </div>    
    Finally, I wanted to see the disparity among states with similar populations, in terms of numbers and demographics.
    For this case, I decided to go with six states of the Midwest: Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Indiana.
    A simple bar chart proved useful for this comparison since we only had data for one interval of time and could not get more
    granular than the state level. 
    Additional data that would be useful would be time series data as well as the size of the populations in urban, suburban, and rural 
    communities.
